DFrame: Final Round Problem statement

During the Covid pandemic, Bablu finally gets the time to try his hand at
gardening. However, his plants soon start dying out and he combs
through the net for advice.
Create an app (or website) which connects an online community of
gardeners and provides them with reliable resources on gardening.

Things to consider:
● Choose your target user.
● Create scenario(s) for user's needs.
● Design relevant, engaging and usable solutions for those requirements.
Design wireframes & flows covering the following phases in a
customer journey:
● Focus on enabling the user to correctly identify the plant
● Provide a few do's and don'ts based on the plant because prevention is better than
cure
● Connect to an experienced gardener or reliable database and figure out what went
wrong.

Evaluation criteria:
● Simplification and Clarity of the solution
● Information architecture
● Unique product thinking (beyond current state-of-the-art)
● Layout and general visual design
● Make intelligent assumptions and mention them succinctly in the document/test

Bonus points:
Personalizing the app experience
